The idea behind portfolio app is to build a project that uses most popular frameworks used in apple ecosystem 
like SwiftUI, Core Data, CloudKit, StoreKit, Widgets and Spotlight.
The app itself is an information tracker used to organise how far one is through completing some sort of task.

I decided to use SwiftUI because I believe that declarative programming is the future of the Apple ecosystem and the mobile in general.
